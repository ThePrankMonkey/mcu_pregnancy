# mcu_pregnancy

Find out which movie your gestating baby is today.

## Inspiration

Recently, my wife stated we were "in the endgame" with the pregnancy. I wanted to find out if that was true, so I wrote something to let me know how far into the MCU the pregnancy actually was. Turns out we were only up to _Avengers: Infinity War_, but _Avengers: Endgame_ isn't that ffar out for us.

## Future Plans

- logger: I'm going to use this to play around with the _logger_ module as it is far smaller than the project I intend to incorporate that into.
- inputs: I'm going to allow you to pass in your dates, first via commandline and eventually I suspect via a tkinter interface maybe.
- validation: I need to validate the dates because it's just sloppy if I don't.
- report: Why not give the date ranges for each MCU movie? That's in the work as well.
